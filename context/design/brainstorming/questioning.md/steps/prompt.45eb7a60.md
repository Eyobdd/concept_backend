# prompt: Can you implement the changes suggested [@20251014\_223905.0eb97c6a](../../context/design/brainstorming/questioning.md/20251014_223905.0eb97c6a.md) and give me the two concepts CallSessionConcept and CallWindowConcept in the same spec format that I gave to you here.

Reminder on formatting and expectations of Concepts according to the 6.1040 rubric
[@concept-state](../background/detailed/concept-state.md)
[@concept-rubric](../background/detailed/concept-rubric.md)
[@concept-specifications](../background/concept-specifications.md)

it should be in the EXACT same format as the spec below. The only difference is that instead of one large on it should be two smaller ones.

\<concept\_spec>
concept CallConcept\[User]

```
purpose
Schedule and initiate calls for a user
```

principle
This concept supports the scheduling and initiation of calls

state
\# A User has a set of windows defining their general availability
a set of Users with
a set of CallWindows

```
# A CallWindow is a generic concept
a set of CallWindows
  a user User

# A Recurring window applies every week on a given day
a RecurringWindows set of CallWindows with
  a dayOfWeek of MONDAY or TUESDAY or WEDNESDAY or THURSDAY or FRIDAY or SATURDAY or SUNDAY
  a startTime DateTime
  a endTime DateTime

# A specific override or one-off window for a particular date
a OneOffWindows set of CallWindows with
  a specificDate Date
  a startTime DateTime
  a endTime DateTime

# The daily CallSession entity, decoupled from the window definitions
a set of CallSessions with
  a user User
  a onDate Date
  a numRetries Number
  a lastAttempt DateTime
  a source of MANUAL or SCHEDULED
  a status of PENDING or MISSED or COMPLETED
  an optional journalEntry JournalEntry

# The central queue for initiated calls
an element CallQueue with
  a pendingCalls seq of CallSessions
```

actions

createCallSession(user:User, date:Date, source: MANUAL or SCHEDULED): CallSession
requires:  There is no existing CallSession cs such that cs.user = user and cs.onDate = onDate
effect:
\- A new CallSession, cs\_new, is added to the CallSessions set.
\- cs\_new.user is set to the input user.
\- cs\_new.onDate is set to the input onDate.
\- cs\_new.status is set to PENDING.
\- cs\_new.numRetries is set to 0.
\- cs\_new.source is set to the input source.
\- cs\_new.lastAttempt and cs\_new.journalEntry are unset.
\- The action returns cs\_new.

deleteCallSession(user:User, date: Date)
requires: There exists a CallSession cs such that cs.user = user and cs.onDate = date.
effect:
\- The CallSession cs is removed from the CallSessions set.
\- If cs is present in CallQueue.pendingCalls, it is removed from that sequence.

enqueueCall(user:User, date: Date)
requires:
\- There exists a CallSession cs such that cs.user = user and cs.onDate = date.
\- cs.status must be PENDING.
\- cs must not already be in the CallQueue.pendingCalls sequence.
effect:
\- cs.numRetries is incremented by 1.
\- cs.lastAttempt is updated to the current system DateTime.
\- cs is appended to the end of the CallQueue.pendingCalls sequence.

createRecurringCallWindow(user:User, dayOfWeek: DayOfWeek, startTime: DateTime, endTime:DateTime): CallWindow
requires: The endTime must be later than the startTime.
effect:
\- A new CallWindow, cw\_new, is added to the CallWindows set and the RecurringWindow subset.
\- cw\_new is added to the user.callWindows relation.
\- cw\_new.dayOfWeek is set to the input dayOfWeek.
\- cw\_new.startTime is set to the input startTime.
\- cw\_new.endTime is set to the input endTime.
\- The action returns cw\_new.

createOneOffCallWindow(user:User, specificDate :Date, startTime:DateTime, endTime: DateTime): CallWindow
requires: The endTime must be later than the startTime.
effect:
\- A new CallWindow, cw\_new, is added to the CallWindows set and the OneOffWindow subset.
\- cw\_new is added to the user.callWindows relation.
\- cw\_new.specificDate is set to the input specificDate.
\- cw\_new.startTime is set to the input startTime.
\- cw\_new.endTime is set to the input endTime.
\- The action returns cw\_new.

deleteCallWindow(window: CallWindow)
requires: The CallWindow window exists in the CallWindows set.
effect:
\- The window is removed from the CallWindows set (and by extension, from whichever subset it belonged to).
\- The window is removed from the user.callWindows relation for the user that owned the window.
