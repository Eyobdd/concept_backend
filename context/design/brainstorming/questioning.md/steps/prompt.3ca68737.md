# prompt: Can you implement the changes suggested [@20251014\_223905.0eb97c6a](../../context/design/brainstorming/questioning.md/20251014_223905.0eb97c6a.md) and give me the two concepts CallSessionConcept and CallWindowConcept in the same spec format that I gave to you here.

Reminder on formatting and expectations of Concepts according to the 6.1040 rubric
[@concept-state](../background/detailed/concept-state.md)
[@concept-rubric](../background/detailed/concept-rubric.md)
[@concept-specifications](../background/concept-specifications.md)

Below is the spec stub for the JournalEntry Concept.

```
<concept_spec>
  concept JournalEntry

  state
    a set of JournalEntry with
      a user User
      a set of Prompts
      a rating Number # An integer between -2 and 2

    a set of Prompts with
      a user User
      a prompt String
      a response String
      a responseStarted Date
      a responseFinished Date
      # Future TODO: since it would likely require using Grid FS
      a audio Audio

  actions
<concept_spec/>
```

Using the following specs as context can you polish the JournalEntry concept(above) and return it in a code block.
