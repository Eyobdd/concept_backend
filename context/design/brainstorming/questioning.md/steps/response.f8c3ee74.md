# response:

Of course. Based on the request to split the `CallConcept` into two more focused concepts, I have implemented the logical separation of concerns.

`CallWindowConcept` now exclusively handles the definition of a user's availability, while `CallSessionConcept` manages the lifecycle of a concrete call instance for a specific day.

Here are the two concept specifications in the requested format.

```
<concept_spec>
	concept CallSessionConcept[User, JournalEntry]

	purpose
    Manage the lifecycle of a specific call instance on a given day for a user.

  principle
    This concept represents the concrete instantiation of a call for a specific date, tracking its state from pending to completion or failure. It handles the "what" and "how" of a specific call attempt.

  state
    # The daily CallSession entity, representing a specific call to be made
    a set of CallSessions with
      a user User
      a onDate Date
      a numRetries Number
      a lastAttempt DateTime
      a source of MANUAL or SCHEDULED
      a status of PENDING or MISSED or COMPLETED
      an optional journalEntry JournalEntry

    # The central queue for initiated calls
    an element CallQueue with
      a pendingCalls seq of CallSessions
    
  actions

  createCallSession(user:User, onDate:Date, source: MANUAL or SCHEDULED): CallSession
    requires:  There is no existing CallSession cs such that cs.user = user and cs.onDate = onDate.
    effect: 
      - A new CallSession, cs_new, is added to the CallSessions set.
      - cs_new.user is set to the input user.
      - cs_new.onDate is set to the input onDate.
      - cs_new.status is set to PENDING.
      - cs_new.numRetries is set to 0.
      - cs_new.source is set to the input source.
      - cs_new.lastAttempt and cs_new.journalEntry are unset.
      - The action returns cs_new.

  deleteCallSession(session: CallSession)
    requires: The CallSession session exists in the CallSessions set.
    effect:
      - The CallSession session is removed from the CallSessions set.
      - If session is present in CallQueue.pendingCalls, it is removed from that sequence.

  enqueueCall(session: CallSession)
    requires:
      - The CallSession session exists in the CallSessions set.
      - session.status must be PENDING.
      - session must not already be in the CallQueue.pendingCalls sequence.
    effect:
      - session.numRetries is incremented by 1.
      - session.lastAttempt is updated to the current system DateTime.
      - session is appended to the end of the CallQueue.pendingCalls sequence.

  markCallCompleted(session: CallSession, entry: JournalEntry)
    requires: 
      - The CallSession session exists in the CallSessions set.
      - session.status is PENDING.
    effect:
      - session.status is set to COMPLETED.
      - session.journalEntry is set to the input entry.
      - If session is present in CallQueue.pendingCalls, it is removed from that sequence.
      
  markCallMissed(session: CallSession)
    requires: 
      - The CallSession session exists in the CallSessions set.
      - session.status is PENDING.
    effect:
      - session.status is set to MISSED.
      - If session is present in CallQueue.pendingCalls, it is removed from that sequence.

```
<concept_spec>
	concept CallWindowConcept[User]

	purpose
    Define a User's availability for receiving calls.

  principle
    This concept manages the recurring and one-off time windows during which a user is available to be called.

  state
    # A User has a set of windows defining their general availability
    a set of Users with
      a set of callWindows of CallWindow

    # A CallWindow is a generic concept defining a time period
    a set of CallWindows with
      a user User

    # A Recurring window applies every week on a given day
    a RecurringWindows set of CallWindows with
      a dayOfWeek of MONDAY or TUESDAY or WEDNESDAY or THURSDAY or FRIDAY or SATURDAY or SUNDAY
      a startTime DateTime
      a endTime DateTime

    # A specific override or one-off window for a particular date
    a OneOffWindows set of CallWindows with
      a specificDate Date
      a startTime DateTime
      a endTime DateTime
    
  actions

  createRecurringCallWindow(user:User, dayOfWeek: DayOfWeek, startTime: DateTime, endTime:DateTime): CallWindow
    requires: The endTime must be later than the startTime.
    effect:
      - A new CallWindow, cw_new, is added to the CallWindows set and the RecurringWindows subset.
      - cw_new is added to the user.callWindows relation.
      - cw_new.user is set to the input user.
      - cw_new.dayOfWeek is set to the input dayOfWeek.
      - cw_new.startTime is set to the input startTime.
      - cw_new.endTime is set to the input endTime.
      - The action returns cw_new.
  
  createOneOffCallWindow(user:User, specificDate :Date, startTime:DateTime, endTime: DateTime): CallWindow
    requires: The endTime must be later than the startTime.
    effect:
      - A new CallWindow, cw_new, is added to the CallWindows set and the OneOffWindows subset.
      - cw_new is added to the user.callWindows relation.
      - cw_new.user is set to the input user.
      - cw_new.specificDate is set to the input specificDate.
      - cw_new.startTime is set to the input startTime.
      - cw_new.endTime is set to the input endTime.
      - The action returns cw_new.

  deleteCallWindow(window: CallWindow)
    requires: The CallWindow window exists in the CallWindows set.
    effect:
      - The window is removed from the CallWindows set (and by extension, from whichever subset it belonged to).
      - The window is removed from the user.callWindows relation for the user that owned the window.
