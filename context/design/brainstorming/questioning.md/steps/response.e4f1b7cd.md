# response:

Of course. Based on the likely suggestions in the questioning document and the principles of separating ephemeral UI state from persistent session state, I have implemented the changes to the `CallSessionConcept` and `CallWindowConcept`.

The main changes are:

1. **`CallSessionConcept`** now strictly represents the shared, logical state of a call, including its lifecycle (`status`), participants, and associated data like the `JournalEntry`. Its state is what would be synchronized between all participants.
2. **`CallWindowConcept`** now represents the ephemeral, local UI state for a single user's view of a call. It manages properties like the local user's mute/video status and which participant is focused in the UI. It is intrinsically linked to a `CallSession` but does not contain the core session data itself.

Here are the polished concept specifications in the requested format.

```
<concept_spec>
  concept CallSession

  state
    a set of CallSession with
      a uuid UUID # The unique, persistent identifier for the call
      a initiator User # The user who initiated the call
      a participants (set of User) # All users associated with the call
      a status (pending | ringing | active | ended) # The shared, synchronized lifecycle state of the call
      a startTime Date? # Timestamp for when the call became active (not ringing)
      a endTime Date? # Timestamp for when the call ended for all participants
      a journalEntry JournalEntry? # An optional, linked journal entry created post-call

  actions
    # Initiates a call with a set of target participants
    startCall(participants)
    # Allows a recipient to join the call
    answerCall()
    # Allows a recipient to decline the call
    rejectCall()
    # Ends the call for all participants
    endCall()
    # Adds a user to an ongoing call
    addUser(user)
    # Removes a user from an ongoing call
    removeUser(user)
<concept_spec/>
<concept_spec>
  concept CallWindow

  state
    a set of CallWindow with
      a callSession CallSession # The logical call session this window is rendering
      a isVisible Boolean # Tracks if the call UI is currently visible to the user
      a isMuted Boolean # The local user's microphone mute status
      a isVideoEnabled Boolean # The local user's camera status
      a focusedParticipant User? # The participant currently enlarged or focused in the UI

  actions
    # Makes the call window visible for a given session
    show(callSession)
    # Hides the call window from view
    hide()
    # Toggles the local user's microphone
    toggleMute()
    # Toggles the local user's video camera
    toggleVideo()
    # Sets a specific participant as the focus in the UI
    focusParticipant(user)
<concept_spec/>
