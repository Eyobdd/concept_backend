# response:

Of course. Based on the brainstorming document's suggestions, here is the `JournalEntry` concept implemented in the specified format. The state from your stub has been integrated, and the purpose, principles, invariants, and actions have been completed in the style of the provided examples.

```
<concept_spec>
  concept JournalEntry

  purpose
    To capture and structure a user's reflections in response to a series of prompts, allowing for review and self-assessment over time.

  principle
    An entry is a discrete, immutable record of a specific journaling session. The overall rating can be changed, but the underlying responses cannot be altered once the entry is created.

  state
    a set of JournalEntry with
      a user User
      a creationDate Date
      a set of Prompts # A set of references to the Prompt objects answered in this session
      a rating Number # An integer between -2 and 2, representing the user's feeling about the session

    a set of Prompts with
      a user User
      a prompt String # The text of the question that was asked
      a response String # The user's transcribed answer
      a responseStarted Date
      a responseFinished Date
      # Future TODO: Link to audio file, likely requiring a separate blob storage solution like GridFS
      a audio Audio

  invariants
    The rating of a JournalEntry must be an integer in the set {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2}.
    For any JournalEntry, its 'user' must be the same as the 'user' for every Prompt in its 'set of Prompts'.
    A given Prompt instance cannot belong to more than one JournalEntry.

  actions
    create_entry(user: User, prompts: set of Prompts, rating: Number): JournalEntry
      requires:
        Each prompt in 'prompts' belongs to 'user'.
        'rating' is an integer between -2 and 2, inclusive.
        None of the prompts in 'prompts' are already associated with an existing JournalEntry.
      effect:
        Creates a new JournalEntry.
        Sets its 'user', 'prompts', and 'rating' from the arguments.
        Sets 'creationDate' to the current time.
        Returns the newly created JournalEntry.

    update_rating(entry: JournalEntry, new_rating: Number)
      requires:
        The JournalEntry 'entry' exists.
        'new_rating' is an integer between -2 and 2, inclusive.
      effect:
        Updates the 'rating' of the specified 'entry' to 'new_rating'.

    delete_entry(entry: JournalEntry)
      requires:
        The JournalEntry 'entry' exists.
      effect:
        Removes the JournalEntry. The associated Prompt objects are unlinked but are not deleted from the system.
</concept_spec>
