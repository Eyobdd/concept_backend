# response:

Okay, I'm ready to answer your "Why...?" question! To give you the best possible answer, I need you to complete the prompt.

**Please tell me what you're curious about!**

For example, you could ask:

* **Why is the sky blue?**
* **Why do we yawn?**
* **Why did the Roman Empire fall?**
* **Why is exercise important?**
* **Why does my cat purr?**
* **Why is there so much plastic in the ocean?**
* **Why is the internet so slow today?** (Though I might not have a specific answer for that!)

**The more specific you are, the better I can understand your question and provide a relevant and informative answer.**

I'm looking forward to hearing what's on your mind!
