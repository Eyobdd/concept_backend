# A User has a set of windows defining their general availability

a set of Users with
a set of CallWindows

```
# A CallWindow is a generic concept
a set of CallWindows with
  a user User

# A Recurring window applies every week on a given day
a RecurringWindows set of CallWindows with
  a dayOfWeek of MONDAY or TUESDAY or WEDNESDAY or THURSDAY or FRIDAY or SATURDAY or SUNDAY
  a startTime DateTime
  a endTime DateTime

# A specific override or one-off window for a particular date
a OneOffWindows set of CallWindows with
  a specificDate Date
  a startTime DateTime
  a endTime DateTime
```

actions

createRecurringCallWindow(user:User, dayOfWeek: DayOfWeek, startTime: DateTime, endTime:DateTime): CallWindow
requires: The endTime must be later than the startTime.
effect:

* A new CallWindow, cw\_new, is added to the CallWindows set and the RecurringWindows subset.
* cw\_new is added to the user.callWindows relation.
* cw\_new.dayOfWeek is set to the input dayOfWeek.
* cw\_new.startTime is set to the input startTime.
* cw\_new.endTime is set to the input endTime.
* The action returns cw\_new.

createOneOffCallWindow(user:User, specificDate :Date, startTime:DateTime, endTime: DateTime): CallWindow
requires: The endTime must be later than the startTime.
effect:

* A new CallWindow, cw\_new, is added to the CallWindows set and the OneOffWindows subset.
* cw\_new is added to the user.callWindows relation.
* cw\_new.specificDate is set to the input specificDate.
* cw\_new.startTime is set to the input startTime.
* cw\_new.endTime is set to the input endTime.
* The action returns cw\_new.

deleteCallWindow(window: CallWindow)
requires: The CallWindow window exists in the CallWindows set.
effect:

* The window is removed from the CallWindows set (and by extension, from whichever subset it belonged to).
* The window is removed from the user.callWindows relation for the user that owned the window.
