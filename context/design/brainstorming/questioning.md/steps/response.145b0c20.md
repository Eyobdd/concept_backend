# response:

Of course. Based on the context provided and the inferred suggestions from your design document, here are the completed specifications for `JournalEntryConcept`, `CallSessionConcept`, and `CallWindowConcept`.

The changes reflect a tighter integration between the user-facing call, the underlying session state, and the resulting data artifact (the journal entry). The `CallSession` now acts as the controller that orchestrates the creation and population of a `JournalEntry` during an active call, and the `CallWindow` serves as the user interface layer for that session.

```
<concept_spec>
  concept JournalEntry

  state
    a set of JournalEntry with
      a user User
      a prompts (a set of Prompt)
      a rating Number # An integer between -2 and 2, null if not yet rated.
      a createdAt Date

    a set of Prompt with
      an entry JournalEntry # The entry this prompt belongs to.
      a promptText String # The text of the question asked.
      a responseText String # The transcribed text of the user's answer.
      a responseStarted Date
      a responseFinished Date
      # Future TODO: since it would likely require using Grid FS
      # a audio Audio

  actions
    # Creates a new, empty JournalEntry for a given user.
    # This is typically invoked by CallSession.create.
    create(user User) -> JournalEntry

    # Adds a new prompt to an existing JournalEntry. Returns the created Prompt object.
    addPrompt(entry JournalEntry, promptText String) -> Prompt

    # Updates the state of a prompt when a user begins their response.
    startResponse(prompt Prompt)

    # Updates the response and completion time for a given prompt.
    updateResponse(prompt Prompt, responseText String)

    # Sets the final rating for the entire journal entry.
    setRating(entry JournalEntry, rating Number)
<concept_spec/>

<concept_spec>
  concept CallSession

  state
    a set of CallSession with
      a user User
      a journalEntry JournalEntry # The data artifact being created during this session.
      a status String # "pending", "active", "completed", "error"
      a currentPrompt Prompt # The prompt currently being presented to the user.
      a createdAt Date
      a startedAt Date
      a endedAt Date

  actions
    # Creates a new session in a "pending" state and its associated JournalEntry.
    create(user User) -> CallSession

    # Transitions the session to "active", sets the start time, and presents the first prompt.
    start(session CallSession)

    # Records the user's answer for the current prompt and determines the next prompt.
    # This action will call JournalEntry.updateResponse.
    answerCurrentPrompt(session CallSession, responseText String)

    # Transitions the session to "completed" and sets the end time.
    end(session CallSession)

    # Applies a rating to the session's associated JournalEntry.
    # This action will call JournalEntry.setRating.
    rate(session CallSession, rating Number)
<concept_spec/>

<concept_spec>
  concept CallWindow

  state
    # There is only one CallWindow, representing the global UI state.
    the CallWindow with
      an isOpen Boolean # Whether the call UI is visible to the user.
      a viewState String # "idle", "prompting", "recording", "finished", "rating"
      an activeSession CallSession # The session currently managed by the window, if any.

  actions
    # Makes the CallWindow visible. Does not start a call.
    open()

    # Hides the CallWindow. If a session is active, it may prompt the user to end it.
    close()

    # A user-initiated action to start a new call.
    # This triggers CallSession.create, links the new session to `activeSession`,
    # and then triggers CallSession.start. It also updates the `viewState`.
    beginCall()

    # A user-initiated action to submit their response to the current prompt.
    # This triggers CallSession.answerCurrentPrompt on the `activeSession`.
    submitResponse(responseText String)

    # A user-initiated action to end the current call.
    # This triggers CallSession.end on the `activeSession` and updates the `viewState`.
    endCall()

    # A user-initiated action to rate the completed call.
    # This triggers CallSession.rate on the `activeSession` and can transition the view
    # back to "idle" or close the window.
    submitRating(rating Number)
<concept_spec/>
