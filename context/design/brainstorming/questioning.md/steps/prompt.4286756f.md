# prompt: Can you implement the changes suggested [@20251014\_223905.0eb97c6a](../../context/design/brainstorming/questioning.md/20251014_223905.0eb97c6a.md) and give me the two concepts CallSessionConcept and CallWindowConcept in the same spec format that I gave to you here.

Reminder on formatting and expectations of Concepts according to the 6.1040 rubric
[@concept-state](../background/detailed/concept-state.md)
[@concept-rubric](../background/detailed/concept-rubric.md)
[@concept-specifications](../background/concept-specifications.md)

Below is the spec stub for the JournalEntry Concept.

```
<concept_spec>
  concept JournalEntry

  state
    a set of JournalEntry with
      a user User
      a set of Prompts
      a rating Number # An integer between -2 and 2

    a set of Prompts with
      a user User
      a prompt String
      a response String
      a responseStarted Date
      a responseFinished Date
      # Future TODO: since it would likely require using Grid FS
      a audio Audio

  actions
<concept_spec/>
```

Using the following specs as a style reference only  and complete the rest of the JournalEntry concept(above) and return it in a code block.

Stylistic Guides:
CallSessionConcept Spec: [@spec](../concepts/CallSessionConcept/spec.md)
CallWindowConcept Spec: [@spec](../concepts/CallWindowConcept/spec.md)

I ONLY want the concept for JournalEntry. note that is should look something like this, though the state should reflect the state above and the actions here are not a complete set of actions.

```
<concept_spec>
  concept JournalEntries

  purpose
    Preserve a conversation transcript as daily structured entries to aid reflection and next-week focus.

  principle
    The concept supports manual viewing/editing of per-day entries.

  state
    a set of JournalEntry with
      a user User
      a date Date
      a gratitude String
      a didToday String
      a proudOf String
      a tomorrowPlan String
      a rating Number # integer −2..2
      a session Session

  invariants
    At most one JournalEntry per (user, date).

  actions
    create_from_session(session: Session): JournalEntry
      requires: session.complete and no existing entry for (session.user, localDate(session))
      effect: parses session Segments into fields; links to session; returns the new entry

    edit_entry(entry: JournalEntry, gratitude?: String, didToday?: String, proudOf?: String, tomorrowPlan?: String, rating?: Number)
      requires: entry exists and if rating provided then rating ∈ {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2}
      effect: updates provided fields (audit trail outside this concept)

    delete_entry(entry: JournalEntry)
      requires: entry exists
      effect: removes entry (does not delete session)
</concept_spec>
```
