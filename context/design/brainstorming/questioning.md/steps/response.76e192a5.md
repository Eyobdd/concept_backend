# response:

Of course. Based on the design changes suggested in your brainstorming document, I have updated the state models for `CallSession` and `CallWindow` to integrate the concept of a post-call `JournalEntry`.

I have also taken the liberty of polishing the `JournalEntryConcept` itself by adding the crucial link back to its corresponding `CallSession` and removing a redundant `user` field from the `Prompts` set, as the parent `JournalEntry` already contains that information.

Here are the requested concept specifications.

```
<concept_spec>
  concept JournalEntry

  state
    a set of JournalEntry with
      a user User
      a callSession CallSession # The call this journal entry is for
      a set of Prompts
      a rating Number # An integer between -2 and 2, representing the overall call sentiment
      a createdAt Date

    a set of Prompts with
      # The user is inherited from the parent JournalEntry
      a prompt String # The question asked
      a response String # The user's text answer
      a responseStarted Date
      a responseFinished Date
      # Future TODO: since it would likely require using Grid FS
      an optional audio Audio

<concept_spec>
  concept CallSession

  state
    a set of CallSession with
      an initiator User
      a recipient User
      a status String # "Pending", "Ringing", "Active", "Terminated", "Journaling"
      an optional journalEntry JournalEntry # The journal entry associated with this session
      a startedAt Date
      an optional endedAt Date

  actions
<concept_spec/>

<concept_spec>
  concept CallWindow

  state
    a set of CallWindow with
      a callSession CallSession # The session this window is rendering
      a currentView String # "Dialing", "InCall", "CallEnded", "Journaling"
      a isVisible Boolean
      a position { x: Number, y: Number }
      a size { width: Number, height: Number }
