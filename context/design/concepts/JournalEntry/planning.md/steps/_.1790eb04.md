# JournalEntry Spec

Use the following context to understand how to write a concept document:
[@concept-design-brief](../../background/concept-design-brief.md)
[@concept-design-overview](../../background/concept-design-overview.md)

Here is the current spec that I have written: [@spec](../../../../../../design/concepts/JournalEntry/spec.md)

Please respond with a commented spec file, addressing and raising any concerns you might have. Additionally, I would love to modify this concept to support a dynamic list of questions that a user provides, rather than a set list of  gratitude, didToday, proudOf, tomorrowPlan, that correspond to the questions, "What are you grateful for Today", "What are you proud of today?", "What are do you want to do tomorrow?". That said it might be best to create a new concept that exclusively responsible for managing the questions that a user wants to ask in their call. If this is the case, indicate that, and produce an updated JournalEntry spec that facilitates this, and a JournalPrompts concept spec that could be synced with this to facilitate this new feature.

Note: The proposed concepts should be minimal and closely follow the format describe here: [@concept-specifications](../../background/concept-specifications.md)

This means that it should resemble the format written in the [@spec](../../../../../../design/concepts/JournalEntry/spec.md) without adding a bunch of extra comments. Each of the proposed concepts should include the purpose, principle, state, and actions exactly as formatted currently.
