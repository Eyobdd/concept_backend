# UserConcept Implementation Notes

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Minimal State
- **Implementation**: Only stores user ID and creation timestamp
- **Rationale**: User is purely an identity concept; all other user data belongs in separate concepts (Profile, UserAuthentication, etc.)
- **Benefit**: Clean separation of concerns, concept independence

### 2. ID Generation
- **Implementation**: Uses `freshID()` utility to generate unique IDs
- **Format**: String-based IDs with type branding for type safety
- **Rationale**: Consistent with other concepts, avoids MongoDB ObjectId complexity

### 3. Timestamp Tracking
- **Implementation**: `createdAt` set to current time on creation
- **Rationale**: Useful for analytics, debugging, and ordering users
- **Note**: Immutable after creation (no update action)

### 4. Error Handling Pattern
- **Type**: Discriminated unions `Empty | { error: string }`
- **Rationale**: Type-safe, descriptive errors, consistent with CallSession pattern
- **Example**: `deleteUser` returns error if user doesn't exist

## Testing Coverage
- 7 test cases covering:
  - Operational principle (create and retrieve)
  - Unique ID generation
  - Delete functionality
  - Error handling for non-existent users
  - Query operations (_getUser, _getAllUsers)
  - Multi-user scenarios

## Concept Independence
- No dependencies on other concepts
- Generic `User` type can be used by any concept via parameterization
- State is minimal and self-contained

## No Design Changes Required
The specification was simple and complete. No changes were necessary during implementation.
