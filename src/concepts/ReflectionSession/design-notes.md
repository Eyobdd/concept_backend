# ReflectionSessionConcept Implementation Notes

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Mutable Until Completed
- **State Transitions**: IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED or ABANDONED
- **Mutability**: Can add responses and set rating while IN_PROGRESS
- **Immutability**: Once COMPLETED or ABANDONED, no further changes allowed
- **Rationale**: Allows flexibility during active reflection, ensures data integrity after completion

### 2. Separate Rating Field
- **Implementation**: Rating stored at session level, not as a prompt response
- **Validation**: Must be integer in [-2, 2]
- **Requirement**: Must be set before completion
- **Rationale**: Rating is meta-assessment of entire session, not a response to a specific prompt

### 3. Position-Based Response Ordering
- **Implementation**: Each response has a position (1, 2, 3...)
- **Uniqueness**: No duplicate positions per session
- **Query Support**: Responses always returned ordered by position
- **Rationale**: Preserves order in which prompts were asked, important for context

### 4. Prompt Snapshot Pattern
- **Implementation**: Both promptId and promptText stored in response
- **Rationale**: 
  - promptId links to original template
  - promptText preserves exact wording at time of response
  - User can modify templates without affecting past sessions

### 5. One Active Session Per User
- **Enforcement**: Cannot start new session while one is IN_PROGRESS
- **Rationale**: Prevents confusion, ensures clean state machine
- **Alternative**: Could allow multiple IN_PROGRESS sessions, but adds complexity

### 6. Expected Prompt Count Validation
- **Implementation**: `completeSession` requires expectedPromptCount parameter
- **Rationale**: Explicit validation that all prompts were answered
- **Benefit**: Prevents incomplete sessions from being marked complete

## Testing Coverage
- 9 test cases covering:
  - Operational principle (full workflow)
  - Single active session enforcement
  - Prompt count validation (1-5)
  - Response recording validation
  - Rating validation (-2 to 2, integers only)
  - Completion requirements (rating + all responses)
  - Session abandonment
  - Response ordering
  - Complete workflow scenario

## Concept Independence
- Depends on generic types: User, CallSession
- No references to other concept implementations
- Prompt information passed as data, not concept references
- Can be used independently for any session-based data collection

## State Machine

```
┌─────────────┐
│             │
│  [START]    │
│             │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ startSession()
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│             │
│ IN_PROGRESS │◄──── recordResponse()
│             │◄──── setRating()
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├──── completeSession() ──────► COMPLETED
       │
       └──── abandonSession() ────────► ABANDONED
```

## Design Trade-offs

### Timestamp Granularity
- **Current**: Single timestamp for responseStarted and responseFinished
- **Alternative**: Track actual start/end times separately
- **Rationale**: For MVP, responses are quick; detailed timing not needed

### Rating Requirement
- **Current**: Rating must be set before completion
- **Alternative**: Rating optional
- **Rationale**: Rating is core to the reflection experience, should be required

### Abandonment vs Deletion
- **Current**: Sessions can be abandoned but not deleted
- **Alternative**: Allow deletion of IN_PROGRESS sessions
- **Rationale**: Preserves audit trail, useful for analytics

## Integration with JournalEntry

ReflectionSession is designed to feed into JournalEntry:
1. User completes ReflectionSession
2. JournalEntry.createFromSession() reads the COMPLETED session
3. Creates immutable JournalEntry with snapshot of all data
4. ReflectionSession remains as audit trail

## No Design Changes Required
The specification was clear and complete. Implementation adds appropriate state validation and maintains clean state machine transitions.
